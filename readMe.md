While I was thinking about what project I wanted to do, I wanted something simple, beginner at coding friendly and fun all at once.

The program creates a 4x4 tic tac toe board, check for a winner, check for a tie, get player's moves, get the machine's moves, after each turns the program will print out the board of the turn including all the moves made previously, it will play the game, and at the end the game the program will print the final board including all the moves made. 

My final project program is straightforward, and any beginners at coding can have easy understanding of the functions. The code is organized into seperate functions which makes it easier to make changes, or maintain. 

What's interesting about my final project is the performance of the board definition. The code can be easily modified(change the size of the board), the code shows how easy, flexible, and adaptable it is. With this code it is able to create a tic tac toe board of different sizes. The flexiblity expands more possibilities, challenges, and creating new strategies. This code encourages creativity, and customizations making it more engaging for other playing as well.
