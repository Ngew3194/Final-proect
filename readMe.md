When I was thinking of what kind of project I wanted to do, I was thinking of doing something easy since i'm still a beginner at coding. At first first I was thinking of create a prgram that will help you dress get dressed for any occasion, for example: "the computer will ask what's the occasion of your event?" you input " date night or cocktail" the comouter will ask you " What are you thinking of wearing?" you input " a dress or jumpsuit" the computer will ask "what color?" you input "black ang gold" and based on that the computer will tell you what kind/color of shoes you should wear, what color coat you should put on, it sounds complicated so i went with tic tac toe. At a young age I loved playing tic tac toe, I was unbeatable. It was harder than what I thought, creating the board, a function that will play was really tough. 


My project, my project is a game of tic tac toe against the computer.
    * I created a function that will first draw me a 4x4 board, at first I wanted a 3x3 but went with the 4x4 to make it just a little bit challenging
    * I assigned X to the player and O to the machine
    * Each column and rows goes from 0-3 
    * the machine
